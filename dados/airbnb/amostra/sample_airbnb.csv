The room and the apartment were very clean, and overall I felt very comfortable with my staying. Totally go back whenever have the chance.",1
9714,"We had a lovely stay at Daniel and Raquel's apartment over the New Year 2013 period,. The apartment was very well located in Ipanema, five minutes walk from Ipanema Beach. We walked to Copacabana Beach (20-25 minutes walk) for the New Years fireworks and celebrations which was incredible. 2 million people dressed in white having a fantastic time, really good fun :) 
Was easy to walk back afterwards, which was ideal as taxi's are always hard to find on New Years wherever you are.

The street on which Daniel and Raquel's apartment is situated felt very safe as did the apartment building, even coming back late at night. Within minutes you have an excellent selection of restaurants and bars. The sushi restaurant, Yusuki, is definitely worth trying. We ate at 3 or 4 other restaurants which were all good, although I would not recommend the Tex/Mex restaurant particularly. There is also a grocery store 3 minutes away.

The apartment itself was very clean and tidy and our hosts could not have been more friendly and pleasant. They went out of their way to make our stay comfortable. 

Would definitely recommend  Daniel and Raquel's apartment, perfect location and great hosts!

301983,"Stayed for a month and I can say it is an excellent place. Fast WiFi, comfortable beds, clean, close to everything, quick responses, safe area and very quite for being in Rio. I can warmly recommend this place as one of the best I have been in when in Rio.",1

205901,"This was my first visit to Brazil, a dream destination for me. I'd searched so many hotels as I really wanted a sea view. I'm so glad I discovered this apartment. It was perfect and so much better than some of the overpriced hotel options.
John (and Filipe) were excellent hosts. So welcoming and available if I needed anything (as they can drop by if needed) Apparently, I was their first international guest. I had no problem communicating with them. In fact, we could have chatted for hours!
The view was perfect and the apartment is as it looks in the photos. I spent a lot of time gazing out of the window. It's also close enough to walk to Ipanema, which I prefer as a more chilled out, idyllic beach, whereas Copacabana has a lot more action and facilities.
The kitchen and shower worked well and there are supermarkets behind the apartment. I loved my stay here and the hosts were amazing. I really hope I get a chance to return. Highly reccommend (unless I am coming back, in which case, go away and find a different place cos this is my special little hideaway! ",1
281902,"Our trip to Rio was even better than expected thanks to Alan! The place was perfect - trendy, comfortable and great location. The huge windows had to be our favorite part because the view from the apartment is beautiful! 

Not only was the spot incredible but Alan was a fantastic host. He was extremely accommodating and communicative with us throughout our time in Rio. We arrived to the city very early in the day and he made sure to have the apartment ready earlier than the normal check in time, which was so thoughtful! 

We love Alan and Rio! Can’t wait to come back!",1

Santa Teresa is a beautiful and artistic part of Rio. The views from the top of the narrow windy streets are breathtaking. Plus Lapa was great for the nights with lots bars and restaurants!
 
Thank you Luiza!  ",1
5181,"We have great time staying at Valerie and Alex's apartment. We stayed for roughly two weeks. Beautiful place that met all our expectations. Valerie's communication before, during and after our stay was a nice bonus. Plus she offered suggestions and answered our questions about Rio..was just what new visitors to Rio needed. Highly recommend Valerie and Alex's apartment.",1

48885,"This was a great stay! Eduardo was a very helpful and dedicated host, making sure everything was ready for me and was very flexible when I needed to extend my stay. 

The apartment is very comfortable with amazing views. The building is very well appointed with professional and friendly door staff. Next door to the property is a natural park with great trails and views at the top.

Easy to get to anywhere in South Zone and the airport by Uber (Note if ordering through Uber, the GPS system on the app can't find the building correctly so you will need to call and explain the location to the driver or he stops on the other side of the park.) Walking to Ipanema is also very enjoyable through a vibrant area of Lagoa park.

Highly recommended :)",1

The apartment was nice and clean and perfect size for two ppl. Great location right next to Copacabana Beach and just a few minutes walk to Ipanema Beach.

50386,"Duda provided a well-accommodated apartment at a supreme location near the beach at a very reasonable price. I have only good things to say about Duda, the building and it's employees. It's the perfect place to enjoy Copacabana.

The neighborhood is decent to Rio standards and I would only suggest to always travel light and avoid carrying bags or anything bulky in your pockets. Aside from that the people are very pleasant and helpful.

Thank you Duda for all the help!",1

174265,"Great studio located very close to the beach. It's clean and well equipped, located in a safe building with a 24/7 security guard. Supermarket, pharmacy, restaurants, money exchange and many other shops are located at walking distance. Ronaldo is a great host : he's reliable and responsive, he helped me a lot. His studio is definitely a great place to enjoy Rio.",1
192582,"We lived in the apartment with three people. Giovanni is a great host. He speaks English and so it's no time a problem to Communicate with him. He always responded to our requests and helped us where he could with tips and many more. For example, it was not a problem earlier than planned and later to move in or out of the apartment. Giovanni was always reachable very quickly. The apartment itself is very spacious and sparkling clean. Everything is available. Also a fully equipped kitchen including dishes is available if you want to cook yourself. The WLAN is very fast and reliable. I would like to say thank you very much for the time in your apartment, Giovanni. We really enjoyed it and thank you for your tips and support. You are a great host! We'll be back!",1

7260,"The studio is in a great location in Ipanema, the beach with the famous posto 9, loads of restaurants, bars and shopping possibilities are in walking distance.
Brunello is a great host, very flexible, responds very quickly to messages and gives comprehensive information about Rio. We asked for an alteration of our booking dates only one day before would actually arrive and he maked it possible for us. I can definitely recommend this place! ",1
129087,"Pol and Bibi are brilliant hosts. Beginning from meeting Pol at a local bar for a drink, to the private movie night and complimentary laundry service, we always felt welcome. The room itself (upstairs) was a pleasant surprise. After 8 months of countless hostels, this was up there with the best and cleanest room we've stayed in, with a private bathroom even. And the animal lovers in us loves that they have a rescued kitten and puppy living with them.
The neighbourhood has a real community atmosphere and we never felt unsafe. Don't be mistaken - it is definitely uphill to get here, but we did the walk multiple times and the thought is worse than actually doing it. And if you can't be bothered or it's too hot, a mototaxi is good fun! Just make sure your nerves are strong.
Pol took us on a walk through the favela to the top of the hill from where we had a unique view of Sugar Loaf, the bay and Copacabana beach.
Pol is instrumental in the community and together him and Bibi are doing their bit to give back to the community to help it grow. 
They have great plans for this place and it will only get better with time.",1

204201,"Lino's apartment is an excellent place to stay!  I've been to Rio a couple of times and stayed in several locations.  This is definitely my favorite!  

Leblon is a beautiful neighborhood and a great location near everything you need to enjoy Rio!  This apartment is located perfectly between shops, food, nightlife and  Leblon beach.  If you want to relax and stay close to the neighborhood, you can have a stress free and relaxing stay!  The rest of Rio is an Uber or Taxi ride away!  

The apartment is even better than the photos show with tons of open space and a cool modern design.  On top of that, the unit is filled with a carefully curated and stylish original art collection.  It was fun to spend some time studying each piece!  

If you're shopping around for a place to stay in Rio, do yourself a favor and choose this apartment!  ",1
70786,"Our stay in Rio in the apartment of Leo &Archanjo was very good even if there has been a  regrettable incident when we arrived.
That is the house was not cleaned. Leo was really surprised ad immediately called person to come cleaning, and asked us come back after two hours.
We asked for another house but it was not possible because were all occupied. So  we left our luggage and go dinner with our friends. After 2 hours Leo sent a message house is cleaned.
We came back, the house was ok. However i think the house need some good renovation, that is  mattress pillows and humidity very high. All this is good suggestion in order to have more clients
The house is in a very good position, near beach, metro, bus, and many restaurants shops and all what you can desire. Third floor ins not a problem at all.
At the end we appreciate very much Leo didnt’ ask money for energy and one glass broken.

It has been a good stay and will come again if arrive in Riio.

23510,"We stayed at Luiz for one week during our first trip to Rio. Luiz was always available to help us plan trips, get around the city, nightlife spots, or with anything else we needed. His house is really great and comfortable, really close to the beach, shops restaurants and bus stations. The room was nice as well. At the end of our stay he arranged for a taxi for us to take us to the airport, which was really helpful. A really great first visit and would definitely recommend to other travelers !",1

134715,"1) About the location
You will be living at the best location of Rio, safe and chic area. I have the say because I have stayed in Rio for 3 weeks and was living in another Airbnb house after staying at Cele’s. Cele’s house is the best choice in terms of quality/price, location, convenience ( metro, supermarket, restaurants, cafes and gym, yes Gym, are literally downstairs) and her hospitality. You will be amazed what a good deal you are getting.

2) About the host Cele
Words cannot even describe 1% of who Cele is and how Cele makes me feel and what this experience in Rio with Cele has inspired me. Cele is someone who is special, warm-hearted, super beautiful physically and soulfully. Our connection is so special that I feel like she is my long-lost sister from the other side of the world. ( I was born and raised in China. I could never imagine that there is someone who thinks, fights for life at the other side of the world the same way as I do). Airbnb is so magical that it connects people who seem have nothing in common but eventually turns out to be your best friend who makes you feel so familiar and close! 

I will come back for this beautiful city and more importantly for this beautiful and magical rencontre of Cele. I believe in destiny and destiny directed me to Cele. Now, it is your turn to be led to Cele and start a new magical experience with her in Rio!",1

227457,"This place is amazing !  400 meter from the beach, close to EVERYTHING !  bars, resturants, nightclubs..  the house next door have a security guard so you feel very safe.  its also a very quiet neighborhood so sleep was never a problem.  Claudia was very easy to communicate with and if i had a question she replied very fast.  i HIGHLY recommend this place, it was also very clean when i arrived :)  thank you for a wonderfull time !",1
30884,"Marcio and Claudio have a great space in a unique location. For seasoned travellers to Brazil you will find their space far superior to most accommodations. from great water pressure in the shower to little touches like the soaps, fresh coffee (and and abundant amount) of coffee, water cooler etc. The neighbourhood is quiet (relative to most of Rio) and a great spot for cycling and walking. We will def stay there again in the future.",1

10660,"We spent 10 days in this flat, and we are more than satisfied! We were with small children, also our friends came to visit us with their small daughter, so our demands were exagerated sometimes. And we are very happy with the choice we did. Very good location, close to shops (nearest one is 3 min by feet) and public transport (metro station just 5 min by feet), extremely responsive guards in condominium, quiet and friendly neighbours. Small room behind the kitchen is very usefull if you have guest or somebody who needs to live alone. Marcelo is extraordinary (for my culture, mabe not for Brazilians) kind and helpful, speak's very good English. With this flat we were in the nice neighbourhood, not far from all the sights and enjoyed in the same time Ipanema!

82140,"The apartment is very conveniently located in Ipanema, a short walk from shops, restaurants, and between two metro stops. Copacabana is also within walking distance. Giovanna is a wonderful and responsive host! ",1
152386,"BRILLIANT! COULD NOT BE BETTER! This really is an exceptionally good Host and apartment. Few come as good as this.
The Host, Alex, could not be more hospitable, always available and attentive. But it's the little details that make this place so exceptional - details Alex provided by Alex. Chocolates on the bed, a fridge loaded with beverages, personalized shampoo and soap, none of which I was expecting. 
The apartment itself is BETTER than in the photos! Much larger [30m2] and stylish. There's a new washing machine, a power shower, ice cold AC, the list goes on and on. 
Did I mention that the large bed is also as good as it gets? The type you lie down on for five minutes, and wake up three hours later...
The building is solid, safe and quiet, located in a side street, which means there is very little noise from outside. Obviously there's no 'ocean view', but why look out when everthing's so wonderful inside?

The location is amazing, literally close to everything in Ipanema. The apartment is beautiful, well decorated, and comfortable. I’ll save this contact to rent it again next time I’ll go to Rio and I am also recommending it to friends and family.
Thanks",1
139155,"We were very pleased when we got to the apartment to see how close it was to the Copacabana beach. When we arrived Fabi was very welcoming and very helpful with information about the area and the best ways to travel around Rio. The apartment was perfect for two of us and would easily work for more people who just want a comfortable place to stay in Rio. Would highly recommend staying here for the value, location and comfort. ",1

The room is big and comfortable. The house is located at Osorio, a good area in Ipanema, where you can feel safe, even in the night. All around there are shops, supermarkets and restaurants.  Ipanema beach is 5 minutes by walk. If I will go back to Rio I would stay at their place again, I got a lot of fun with them!

44254,"We stayed at this house for the Olympics since the events we came to watch where at the Deodoro venue. The house was as advertised, big enough for 4-5 people, with good features and great proximity to the Deodoro venue. There is a convenient neighborhood grocery store and the Bangu Shopping Center is a short Uber ride away. We took Uber many times from the house with no problems. I would not walk to the train station -- it seemed a little sketchy near the station. ",1

62176,"Marjons house is out of a dream, nestled inside a lush forested hill, with christ looking over. The house was easy to locate, and very well connected by bus to the centre of Santa Teresa, which is a beautifully ambient neighbourhood. Marjon's very affectionate cats and dogs made us feel at home. And Marjon herself is an incredibly knowledgeable person and a warm host. 
Nature almost spills into this house, which is what makes it special. However as a result, maintaining the house is a challenge. There will be monkeys, birds, bugs and of course dogs and cats around. The open kitchen will tend to get dusty. While these were hardly issues for us, people who have outrageously high expectations about cleanliness should are not encouraged to stay here.",1
245892,"Apartment very nice, and in a strategical position in Rio.",1
2312,"Great place! The apartment is walking distance to Copacabana and Ipanema beach, the metro, and the main square where there is a craft fair on Sundays. Valeria was very communicative and helpful. Also, there is a doorman in the lobby is always available to answer questions. The only downside is that it is a little loud on weekend nights because of the music on the street. Would definitely recommend this spot!",1

I can recommend to everyone!",1

35816,"The only suitable word is great. Appartment is in great neighborhood, five minutes to the beach (Copacabana). All the buses go there, it almost seemed that anywhere we go we always end up on Barato Ribeira street so we couldn't get lost even if we tried. Taxi from SDU airport is cheap there as it's close. Local bus from the bus station stops in this street as well. What else could we wish.

The appartment was clean, well equipped, had everything we needed, fridge, microwave oven, hot/cold shower. We had towels prepared as well so we had everything we could ever need.

Carlos was really nice to us, communication without any problem, we met at the doorstep as we agreed, we got the keys and we could enjoy! On our last day he even left us to stay there untill late because our bus to Sao Paulo was in the evening. Thank you for eveything!

For those who do not speak English :-)

He took great care of us; he arranged airport transportation, refilled our drinking water, provided new linens in the middle of our stay, and was so friendly and helpful our whole stay. 
Definitely stay here or any of Jose's apartments and you will be sure to have an amazing stay in rio. ",1
282030,"I had a great time in Rio. I felt so safe in Marcio’s place, so well designed and close to beach. Marcio was a great host, and so helpful. It is really close to Posto 9 at Ipanema beach - loved it loved loved it",1
35757,"The location of the apartment cannot be better, it’s just 2 blocks away from Copacabana beach. Ipanema beach is just a short stroll away (20-30 minutes, depending how fast you can walk). 

Two blocks away is Cantagalo Metro station, great to go to the Centro or Lapa and save on taxis. 

Big supermarket is also few blocks away and most conveniently a small bakery is just few doors away where you can get fresh bread and pastries every morning. 

Although the building is on the noisy street, the apartment is at the back, meaning you can’t hear any of the traffic and street noise, which are usually very loud everywhere in Rio.

The apartment is very clean and really spacious for a couple such as we were, it has plenty of space in the bedroom part, which is great again if you are a couple. The bed is large and comfortable too. The bedroom has a view of the hill behind the building and other buildings are quite far away. There is enough wardrobe space to put all your belongings away from sight. 

The kitchen has everything you need for a short stay in Rio, big fridge and a cooker. The “living room” part is smaller than the bedroom and has sofa-bed where another two people can sleep. There is also a fold-out table and a TV with enough channels to satisfy a Brasilian.

Another aspect, which is important to me for working on the go, is the Internet Wi-Fi connection - the signal was strong and speed was fast enough to do anything.

Carlos, the host, is really sweet and accommodating, speaks good English and answers emails really quickly.

I highly recommend this apartment to anyone, especially on a budget.

54531,"I was not welcomed by the host so I never got to meet her. The key was left with the doorman. The place was very small and not fit for long term stay. I had problems from the start, there was no pans or utensils but just a bare minimum. I asked for more things and the host provided some stuff but I did ask for these things to be there and was assured there was everything at the place. I had to buy a bottle opener. The counter top was very sticky the vanish used was wrong. The worktop itself was coming away from the wall. I told the host about this but it was not fixed, instead she got the cleaner to prop it up with a chair and towels so I could not use the cooking facility from then on it was out of action. I done an all inclusive price but the host still asked me to pay extra on top of this to the maid. I was not happy about this but the host threatened me to leave the place if I did not pay so I paid 200 real in cash to the maid just to get the host off my back. The air-conditioner was not working properly and dripped water on to the floor. The host kept on harassing me on whatsap about the things that was a fault of her bedsit that in my opinion is not fit for purpose for a long stay and the host agreed this in a conversation to me. A couple of glasses were broken and I was constantly harassed to pay 80 real for this but I refused to pay because I thought the host was just trying to get more money out of me. After all I did pay the cleaner outside of airbnb that I believe I should not have but did it just to get her off my back so a couple of glasses I thought was no big deal. I have lots of whatsap conversation with the host that I have saved if airbnb would like a copy I can send. I came to Brazil for a holiday not to unnecessarily talk to the host and be stressed throughout my stay because of her faulty place. On the last day I had enough, the cleaner never arrived and I decided to spend that night in a hotel because there were lots of flies in the bathroom and the cleaner did not turn up for over a week even though I paid. Even then when I told the host I have left the bedsit and decided to stay in a hotel for the last night because of the situation she was not sympathetic at all, instead she decided to harass me for hours about the broken glasses. So overall my first airbnb experience was a bit of a nightmare. I would not recommend this place and hope never to hear from this host...",0
4026,"In my opinion, Angelica is everything an Air BnB host should be...warm, welcoming and generous with her space and her time. We loved her perfectly located apartment in the Gloria neighborhood, a super short walk to the Metro station and very close to Santa Teresa where we spent a lot of time. Angelica gave us a lot of helpful info on the area and in Rio in general. She even purchased us our Metro cards for Cobacabana New Year's Eve travel before our arrival so that we would be assured a transportation option on that night. We loved everything about staying here and highly recommend it. Obrigado Angelica! ",1

42403,Large spacious apartment with stunning views. In the vicinity of the mass of shops and bars. Flamengo beach (clean and little frequented beach) can be reached on foot in 10 minutes. Quiet area. I would recommend to anyone.,1

238285,This is a great and stylish loft in good location in Ipanema close to posto 9.  beach a few blocks down and all that you need for a nice stay is close by. Security at the gate is very helpful and nice and makes sure no uninvited guests are let in.,1
22150,"The Place is awesome with every thing you need
Not Only it is exactly as described on the photos and the location is great very near from the beach and from a street with every kind of shop you need 
But  probably one of the best things is tat the Owner Janaina is really helpful seeking for her guests to have a nice experience, not only she had a good communication before and during our stay 
But she also came to receive me (when there was no need since there is already a reception in the building) she even accompanied me to show when to fin a place to exchange money , and as that place was close she changed money for me herself … little details that surely make a difference
Thank you Janaina for you kindness and for the good time spent in your apartment

195970,"A small and clean apartment with good location, very close to Avenida Praia do Flamenco where you can take bus 2018 all the way to Galeao airport for very cheap.

The only thing I missed was perhaps a little stove to cook basic warm meals now and then. However there is a fancy microwave that I didn’t use. Ate most of my meals out, except for breakfast.

The guys in the reception speaks no english and I speak no portugese, so there was a bit of confusion until they understood why I was there. But then they just called Marcella and it was fine. And recommend this place, especially to people travelling alone.",1
138455,"We had a brilliant time staying at Vania's apartment, so much so that we extended our stay for another two days. Vania was an amazing host and made sure we had everything that we needed.

Thanks again Vania for making our time in Rio so enjoyable.",1

95467,"Alessandro’s place is amazing. I want to start off by saying that the check-in is super fast, easy, and it makes you feel extremely safe. According to everyone that I met, Leblon is one of the best places to stay in, so I am glad I picked this place. I would definitely recommend anyone to stay here.",1

This amazing apartment is in a great location just 10 mins walk from red beach and just down the road from a shopping mall with easy access to taxis and buses.

It's open plan and incredibily beautiful with clear wievs of Cristo Redentor on one side and the Sugur Loaf on the other.

This apt and this location are perfect if you have great taste and you'd like something unsual and off the beaten track. 

Conor and Adriana were great hosts and could not have been more helpful and friendly and this was definitely the best apartment we've ever stayed in.!

97840,Loved my time in Beatriz’s studio the location was perfect and is very close to Copacabana and very safe neighborhood.,1
53736,Adriano was an amazing host. His apartment is pretty close to the beach and the Metro station. The area was very alive during carnaval. Definitely I great place to stay in Rio.,1
159986,"If you are looking for a place close to Copacabana beach, its hard to beat. Don't expect anything fancy, the building is old and the appartment needs a bit of TLC. The old and stained sheets were my biggest disappointment. If you are not a clean freak then it might just be OK, the air con is loud but it's functional in the 3 rooms. Wifi isn't the best but apparently there was a problem with the service provider during our stay and the host quickly took care of it. In terms of communication, the host was available and offered nice local tips. In the end if you don't plan on cooking or staying in much, the place is great mostly for the location. But its not your romantic getaway...",0
61039,"We spent a wonderful weekend in Rio in this flat. It is accurately described- actually that’s a lie! I missed out on the fact when I was booking it that there were TWO bathrooms! So a great and very welcome surprise! The communication was easy and very friendly. Everything we needed was resolved quickly. The space itself is wonderful- stylish, clean and soothing. Great to relax but also has a work desk which was perfect for our work- relaxation break. It’s not right next to the beach but on a quiet street about 5 minutes away - we knew that when booking and were quite happy with the location. The space is co-hosted by Cândida and she was absolutely brilliant. So thank you Rosângela and Cândida for a great stay - we will be back! ",1

286975,"Would recommend without hesitation for up to two travelers.  But the fold-out couch, which allows to host up to two more people, is not extremely comfortable. Good enough if you only stay a night or two though. But other than that, we truly had a great stay and Newton has been great to us.",1

Plenty of cooking, coffee making facilities if you need, but so many great restaurants that our friendly helpful awesome hosts told us about! We asked to stay 2 extra days on our original booking and viviane was so good to arrange it all! ",1
152716,"Everything was very good! The apartment is just like you see in the pictures: very simple, small, but it had everything we needed. It was also very clean.
The location is great. Copacabana is a fun neighborhood, although it can be kind of dirty and noisy, specially on the weekends. But the best thing about Marlyan's apartment is its closeness to the beach. You can walk one minute and arrive to a beautiful beach (with lots of people but beautiful nonetheless). This was glorious.
If you think Copacabana could be the kind of neighborhood you'd like, this apartment is a great option. I would definitely go there again.",1
81951,"Fabulous apartment in a great location. Very clean and tidy and perfect for our needs. We felt very safe with the doorman, who we both friendly.

Boima´s apartment was  really  clean  relaxed and cute . The beach is about 10 min walk from there. Boima  was  a carrying host,  he  gave all the information  I needed before and during my stay. So I would definitely recommend this apartment if you're planning to stay in  Barra  da Tijuca Rio.",1
246019,Great location for our quick one-night stay in Rio. Close to the beach and restaurants. There are two pull-out couches (big enough for a couple on each) and a separate bedroom. Deisy was very lovely and hospitable and made everything very easy for us. Thank you!,1

Only downside was a giant construction site right besides the building that worked 24/7. Lots of noise and it was hard to sleep without earplugs. ",1

It's extremelly well located. A 10 min walking distance from the Bothanic Garden Park, and 5 min car distance to Leblon and Jardim Botanico neighborhoods. 

You have also an easy way going to Rio's downtown as well as to Barra da Tijuca wich are the old and the new areas of the city.

The apartmemt itself is wonderfull. Very nicelly decorated, and with great quality stuff all over. From towels to glasses and plates, from the washing machine  to the shower. All very well done.

Its been such a pleasure that my two weeks rent became one month and a half. And I felt all of the time like home.

The place is very close to Copacabana beach (2 min walking) and full of restaurants, bars, markets, etc. Our bedroom was pretty comfortable, with a big and nice bed. Bathroom was a little bit small, but it was always clean and very well equipped. Living room was big, with 2 nice couches, great illumination and good music. 
Ylza lives with Vranca and Blu (cat and dog, respectively). Both animals are well domesticated and they were always friendly with us. 
We encourage to you to visit Ylza at Rio.

266686,"We were 4 people staying at Vitor's and Carlo's apartment in Copacabana. The flat was BEAUTIFUL! Just one block from Copacabana beach. The area is very alive as you are quite close to a favela but we never felt unsafe. The flat has huge windows in the living area which gives you the uow factor during the day. They have 3 spacious bedrooms which fit 6 adults. The beds, pillows and even the couch were super comfortable. The flat was very stylish and modern, which we loved. They have 3 bathrooms in total and they all look nice. The hot shower was not getting very warm but okay warm. I have reported that to the boys. The communication with them was perfect from the beginning to the end. The check-in went very smooth. I told them they were missing a trash-bin in the small toilet and the promptly fixed that by sending one. The internet was not working very well which has also been reported (not a major issue). My only suggestion is to add two more dining chairs around the table. The flat fits comfortably 6 people and it would be nice to have everyone around the table for a breakfast with a view. I would easily stay in the flat again and I strongly recommend this flat to anyone looking for a place to stay in Rio.",1
265231,"Cleide’s apartment was great. The building is amazing and the rooftop terrace with a pool offered spectacular views of the city. It is literally one block from Ipanema Beach, so location couldn’t be more perfect. The apartment was spacious and worked well for our group. One note that was no fault of anyone is that there were issues with the plumbing in the building basically our whole stay, which didn’t allow us to flush the toilet in our room or use hot water to shower. So those tasks needed to be done in the rooftop public restrooms. But this did not overshadow everything else that was wonderful. We would stay here again when visiting Rio.",1

This was my 5th time to Rio and I can tell you that the apartment is optimally located about a 3 minute walk from the beach and it's directly across the street from one of the only 24hr supermarkets in Rio.

6142,"Really perfect! 
I really had a perfect stay in Lucia's house, which is very clean. I felt there total hospitality. Lucia and her family are such special hosts. They are always friendly, reliable, honest, flexible, generous, open-hearted and minded, lovely and last but not least extremely funny.
In case of questions or problems – no problem to ask everyone in the family. They help as much as they can. Besides they try everything to make you feel comfortable. Their advices and recommendations valid as gold, means that they are very useful.
Moreover Lucia took off a day from work to spend it with two other guests (greetings to Lorena and Catalina!) and me to show us visitors the city. It was an amazing day I never forget.
Though Marechal-Hermes is a litte bit far from the centre, there run busses and trains, which bring you easily to where you like to go. I even had so funny times in the train, you can't imagine.
I can easily recommend Lucia as host. You will not regret. I like to travel some more places in Brazil, not just Rio de Janeiro. But I would truly need to return to Rio de Janeiro, just because I love to see Lucia, family and friends again.
Lucia, I thank you (and your family) very much!",1

As for the apartment itself - its a cozy size but roomy enough for 2 people.  The bedroom is separate from the living room.  There are 2 balconies - one off the living room and one off the bedroom.  There is cable TV as well as WiFi and a full kitchen (though we didn't use it).   

There is a cleaning service so your apartment is made up every day.  Its not like a typical Airbnb in that sense.  Its also super easy to check in and out as there is a door person who is seemingly very comfortable with Airbnb guests (though they don't speak English like most folks in Rio!). ",1

We stayed during the carnival and not only did they suggest the best blocks (street carnaval parties), local attractions and restaurants but also showed us around with the local perspective. We didn't know the local language but they being around, actively responding and helping us through messages made our trip awesome.The location of the apartment is central and safe (opposite a metro station, shopping complex opposite and beach 4 blocks away).

9882,"We stayed at Fabios place for a couple of days and fully enjoyed the super clean and well located apartment. Right in front  is a bus stop with connections to any touristy place in Rio. We found it a really good base in Copacabana to explore the wonderful city. The beach is a short walk and can be seen from the window. The apartment is really good equipped with new appliances and has everything you need. The building has 24 hours security and is very safe. 
Fabio is the perfect host. He was easy to deal with and answered very quickly to all our questions. On top of that he gave us good tips on things to do while we were there. When we arrived he was awaiting us as agreed in the apartment and introduced us to everything. Another day I had to print some stuff which he did for me and brought it the the apartment. Great guy.

Just a perfect place to stay in Rio. We loved Rio so much that we will definitly return and stay again at Fabios place if possible.

Highly recommended.",1

Only problem is there were repairs being made to another apartment and it was impossible to escape the noise from the hammering, drilling, and plastering between 8:30 AM - 4pm. Regardless, I was happy with my stay.",1

The appartment is really well decorated, very colourful, with all the amenities you need. Perfect for couple or 2 persons. There is always a portier at the entrance although the neighborhood is safe. Wi-fi is going fast. Air-con is also working well.

Bed is big and room is spacious. Bathroom is shared with another room. Antonio is very accommodating- we got sick on our trip and he moved us into another of his rooms with a private bathroom.

We generally felt safe throughout our stay too. Patricia and Paulo were perfect hosts, staying in contact from the time we booked, providing useful information and tips and always being very quick to respond to messages. Extra touches such as drinks in the fridge when we arrived and booking a special rate taxi to the airport on departure were greatly appreciated as well.  This all helped make for a fantastic holiday in what is a really stunning city.  Hugely recommended. ",1

Highly recommended.",1
79413,Excellent place to stay. Amazing Leblon near everything!! Good host. Recomended 100%.,1
135022,"The flat is fantastically located, near the beach and the metro. It is big for a studio, and very clean. Fernanda is an efficient, hands-off hostess, who replied to all my emails quickly. Alhtough the flat is light and airy, the public corridors and stairs are really run-down and not the cleanest, so the first impression one has is not great, but it is (in spite of appearances) a great place to stay. The one real problem I found in the flat was the window: it is an extremely heavy metal sash window, which requires someone really strong to open. It is also very difficult to control how much you open it. If you like aircon you will be fine, but I love fresh air and was there at a time of year when the temperature outside was a bliss, so I nearly got hurt trying to keep the window open. Fernanda was sympathetic and explained she will change the window when she can find some money to do it. Other than that it is a fantastic studio in a perfect location, very near the metro and two bocks from the beach. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes around, a good bakery and a supermarket.",1
23684,"I booked Marcelo's place last minute on my way to Rio and glad I did. He accepted almost instantly and was extremely accommodating. Locating and entering the building and apartment was a breeze. The flat is as described/pictured and even better upon arrival. Very clean and updated space in the heart of Copa with any and all necessities within a 5min walk, beach included. I highly recommend this place and will definitely rent it again. ",1
226034,"I really enjoyed staying at this place. If you wanna try staying in a favela (to have a local experience) then this is the place guys. It is a safe place to stay with a police booth right in the middle of the favela. Beautiful view of the ocean. You have to hike a bit and take stairs. If not, motobikes are available to give you a ride. Close to leme and Copacaba beaches. Thank you host :-)",1

Alan together with his mother are great hosts. They have even prepared us a breakfast every morning. It was really nice. Totally recommend.,1

It's a great perk that the apartment is an elevator building with on site super and maintenance. And the location couldn't have been better, very easy to get around from and go for strolls. 

Thanks again and again! ",1
79695,"Maria and Carlos were at the apartment to greet my wife and I.  They were both very nice and welcoming.  The apartment was clean and just as described.  It is small, but perfect for a couple.  The location was great as it is only 2 blocks from Copacabana beach and 5 blocks from the Siqueira Campos metro station which we used a lot to access the Olympic venues.  The building had a doorman from early in the morning until 10pm and the building has a locked outer gate, locked inner door (at night), and of course the apartment door.  Security was not an issue.  I highly recommend Maria's apartment as the price is great, the location is even better, and Maria and Carlos are as nice as can be.

All in all a really great experience :) ",1
18318,"We had a great stay at Jeanne's! The apartment is very charming and safe, with an amazing view and a relaxing sound of the waves. Jeanne was a great host and provided all needed. The location is quiet and secluded though a bit south of central Leblon, so about a 15 min walk to more central restaurants, shops, and the metro. A great place for some R&R and a short walk to the beach!",1
203109,"Cybelle is an AMAZING host. We were visiting Rio for carnival and did not have enough time to pick up our carnival tickets. We were worried and unsure about how to handle the ticket pick up/delivery process. Cybelle went above and beyond to help us. She helped us translate the process, fill out forms and picked up our tickets for us. Once we arrived at the apartment, she was waiting with everything needed in order to just drop off our things and head straight to the parade.

I cannot express how appreciative we were. She even had detailed directions to carnival and weather in Rio printed out for us once we arrived. She was also very accommodating with late check out.

I highly recommend Cybelle and her apartment! Thank you Cybelle!",1
115301,"Villa Sofia is a dream. Comfortable, clean and easy to settle into as you listen to the sounds of the neighborhood drift across the courtyard. We pretty much had the place to ourselves during our stay. The location is unbeatable if you want to get away from the main areas in Rio (and even if you want get away from the main areas in Santa Teresa!). It wasn’t our first visit to Rio and we were happy to find how close the house is to a few bus routes and a supermarket. The best bar is just down the street and of course you’re close to all the popular spots in Santa Teresa. Though we didn’t meet in person, Anna’s communication was quick, clear, and always helpful. The home is tastefully decorated with a great little library and lots of room to read, write, eat, and take life easy.",1

9839,"Location location location.  Fernanda’s apartment is excellently located 2.5 blocks from the beach.  24/7 very large supermarket, ATMs and pharmacies are around the block, the metro station is 4 blacks away, all major bus lines stop within two blocks, very good bars and restaurants are all within walking distance including a “Subway” sandwich store.  Returning from a downtown disco one late night (early morning) we asked the taxi driver to take us to a good place to eat good food, anyplace would do.  He took us to Cervantes, incredibly just a few steps away from the apartment!   A major shopping center is a fifteen-minute walk . 

The apartment is fully equipped, plenty of towels, sheets, hangers in the closet, all the necessary cooking utensils, large brand new fridge, clothes washer, etc.  The shower is strong and the gas-powered heater provides endless hot water.  The free high-speed internet is a definite plus and, if you come from the U.S., the possibility to call home at no added expense is also a welcome bonus.

The only downside we could find is that the sunlight shines right onto the bed very early in the morning.  A “blackout” would have helped.  This was my first experience with Airbnb.  Airbnb’s professional pictures also makes the apartment look larger than it really is, but I guess that is the same with the other listed apartments (see https://www.airbnb.com/info/photography).  A coffee table which appears in one of the pictures was stored above the closet and for space-sake, we kept it there.

Overall, we found Fernanda to be a terrific host and answered all of our e-mailed questions within a couple of hours.  Having lived in Rio as a kid I did not really have to rely on her too much but I’m sure she would have been an excellent tourist guide as well (she e-mailed me a list of must-see attractions).  Definitely recommendable!

It was nice to be set back from the beach a bit, the jungle surrounding was serene and beautiful. Patricia met us when we arrived, and allowed us to stay late on our last day. Loved having breakfast on the balcony. Security was excellent, 24hr doorman. We felt safe walking home. Our favorite restaurants (Patricia's recommendations) were O'Caranguejo (Copa) and Zaza (Ipanema). ",1

1265,"From the moment we were greeted by our friendly and knowledgable guide Bruce, we knew we were in for a unique and personal experience. The next 4 hours proved to be just that, as we were escorted behind the scenes to catch a glimpse at the inner-workings of the Opera House, and then above the scenes and treated to phenomenal performance in the Concert Hall, from within the 'lighting room' above the auditorium. This experience is a must for arts/music enthusiasts who are seeking a new way to experience the Opera House, and I could imagine it would be just as rewarding for first-time visitors as well! It was a thoroughly exceptional and professional experience that I would easily recommend. Thank you!",1
31239,"Rio is an incredible city. Staying at Mary has made our experience even better. If you are looking to be in a safe neighborhoud, with Copacabana and Ipanema beaches both a few minutes walking away (as well as transportation, shops and restaurants), in a clean and tidy apartment with all necessary amenities and a super nice host, look no further.
The bed is comfortable, there is a ventilator, closet space and a tv (we didn' use it) and a perfectly clean bathroom. The street noise is very much contained as the street is quiet and it is on the 6th floor.
As to the host, we couldn't say enough what an enjoyable person she is and how she helps out in any way she can. Even if we didn't speak a word of Portuguese.
We'll be back soon!!!!",1

I’d stay here again in a heartbeat. Thank you, Rafael!",1

Everything were as we had hope to be. the safe neighborhood, location and the studio condition. 

Do's 
* Hiking with Jeanne and her Dogs is a Must, you will love the park behind the house. 
* Utilize Sheraton hotel around the corner if you get Hotel sick!! You are closer to pool area and restaurants than some of the hotel rooms! :)
* Explore Leblon area around the corner, It is a safe and lovely district. 
*Have Breakfast on Balcony before eight AM. It is so lovely 
* Watch the sun rise from your Balcony. 

Dont's
* Try not to go to Copacabana too often as we found the area very unsafe for tourists.

It is very spacious, has AMAZING views, is in an excellent safe area, the apartment has character, it's very clean and tidy and has all the appliances you're looking for. We stayed over carnival which means the city was heaving. Being on the 16th floor with 2 balconies and heaps of space was a true respite from the crowds and noise when we needed it. The location is perfect! All Taxi drivers know the road, there are a few restaurants close by that are popular with locals, the supermarket is across the road and bus stop 50m away. 
Regina and Zezito couldn't be better hosts - we went to a local bar to watch them perform in a band - music unique to Rio de Janeiro so the perfect way to be introduced to the city! Snap this place up! Highly recommended! ",1
296932,Very nice place close to the beach. Hosts were great and kind.,1
259,"My boyfriend and I had a lovely stay in Rio de Janeiro due to our stay at  Viviane's Copa flat. Her apartment was immaculately clean and well located from the beach area. Not more than a 5 minute walk. The neighbourhood felt safe and supermarkets, laundry services, and metro were all easily accessible.

Also, we were impressed with her kitchen which seemed well stocked with all the cooking utensils we needed to prepare simple meals.

Lastly, her suggestions and guide for touring Rio were endless and her reasons to visit particular areas of the city added a wonderful personal touch to the trip. 

Overall, our trip to Rio was more like staying at a friend's place. It was so nice to have this home-like feeling, even when millions of miles away from our own.

Thank you Viviane!",1
219435,Thais's appartement was good. The location was great. We had a really nice stay! ,1
292928,It is a nice apartment and good location - disappointed the host tried to charge us more money after we stayed. He stated we were 4 guests vs. 2 guests and tried to have Airbnb collect more money from us. He didn't communicate this with us or anything - I wouldn't trust booking with this host in the future.  There are cameras in the building so if needed clear evidence we were only 2 people. He had no reason to think there were 4 people. Seems like a scam to collect more money.,0
7114,"The apartment is a clean, fully equipped compact studio apt. in the heart of Ipanema, only three blocks from the beach: a really awesome spot in town! Brunello was a great, helpful host.",1

84040,"First of all I want to thanks Carlos Henrique for accept me and my husband Doug as a guest. His apartment is nice and the area is excellent. It's comfortable , and if you enjoy the breeze from the ocean, just open windows and doors. The veranda was so nice and we spent a nice time there.The view is so beautiful and we just cross the street and are on the beach !The front desk people is very kind and try to help in many ways. I never met  Carlos Henrique in person, however, he is always there when you need something. He called me sometimes and as he has a good internet connection , so we could communicate also through Emails .",1

There were no issues or complications-everything was truly perfect. The apartment is in a great location absolutely in the middle of everything in a very safe and upscale area. ",1

296272,"Arthor's place was the best decision I made!  (as a person that don't want to go to the overpriced and standard boring apartments.)
The view here is just breathtaking! and all around is green. The apartment located in a beautiful street, close to the luxury Sheraton Grand Hotel, which is sharing a beach with. In addition, it surrounded with restaurants and bars in one of the safest place in Rio. 
The apartment is a few minutes from the world's two most famous beaches, the Ipanema and Copacabana. 
And in the evening there is the most vibrant night life in Rio de Janeiro including club bars and dance floors. 

 It was an amazing experience for me! 
 on my next visit, I will surely come back to stay here.",1

The location of the apartment is awesome, you walk like 50mts ir less and you are in the beach of Ipanema. Really awesome. The apartment is very well equipped and it's very well designed. Thanks a lot Rafael!",1
32783,"I and a couple of friends stayed at Ludmilla's apartment in Vidigal. We were most delighted by this cozy place with a view to the sea at Vidigal Rd, right up from Niemeyer Av, few yards from the Sheraton Rio. Basically It's perfect for young honeymooners but It fits to an extra one If privacy is not the number one priority. it's quite well serviced with a small kitchen and If you may need some extra help, Ludmila and her husband live next and are most ready to assist. Also It's a walking distance to Leblon neighbourhood and If you walk a little bit more, to Ipanema where the boys' action fires up :) For the first timers and foreigners less used to security issues It's a surprisingly well patrolled spot with a round-the-clock police. And as It's gay friendly It catered perfectly for my friends! Whenever I'm back with them, I'll deffo come back",1
491,"My wife and I just finished staying in Renata's place for three nights. It was a fantastic stay. I highly recommend it. The location is perfect - just two blocks from Ipanema beach. The neighborhood is very safe and calm and it's surrounded by great restaurant, juice bars, and shopping. The apartment itself is very cozy and clean and charming. She even left our favorite Brazilian chocolates there waiting for us when we arrived!",1
59877,"Rafaella and Fernanda are excellent hosts. They were always prompt in our exchanges and Fernanda was absolutely flexible in our arrival, willing to change plans at the last minute when my apartment mates had problems with their flight. Fernanda was very clear during the check-in, explaining in details all the ins and outs of the apartment and tried her best to make our stay comfortable. She was always very accessible through (Hidden by Airbnb) and left a ton of brochures with us with helpful transportation and tourism information. 

The apartment itself is very good. It is located in an old building that does not look great from the outside (like almost all buildings in Copacana) and it has some small quirks, especially with some of the plumbing occasionally leaking a bit and the hot water taking some time to start. However, absolutely nothing detracted from the experience as everything in the apartment is very functional and the furniture is comfortable. The AC in the rooms works well and all nights were spent soundly asleep. Storage in the main room was excellent and in the smaller room it was more than sufficient. The kitchen is very functional and well-equipped.

One of the big advantages of the apartment is its location. It is located just behind the Copacabana Palace, the most traditional hotel in Rio. There are coffeehouses and bakeries nearby for breakfast and many restaurants serving all types of food and with all types of price levels. There are a couple of supermarkets nearby and the Cardeal Arcoverde subway station is less than 150 m away. Copacabana beach is located about one block away and there are many shops all around the hotel. The doormen in the building were always very helpful in recommending places to go nearby.

Overall, an excellent experience and I highly recommend this apartment for anyone staying in Copacabana. I also highly recommend Rafaella and Fernanda as hosts and in my next time in Rio I will certainly look for them again.",1

Our late evening flight from london was two hours late and did not get to the apartment until 2330 , Marina was waiting there for use which was very appreciated! On our last day of our holiday we had a late flight to catch and again Marina kindly let us stay at the apartment until the time we needed . The apartment itself was nice, comfortable and location amazing, we definitely recommend marina 's apartment. Thank you Marina !

108894,"Freddy is a great host!  We had lots of questions and he helped answer them all very promptly over airbnb messenger. He gave great suggestions of what to do depending on our preferences - it was like having a friend in Rio that we never met. The apartment looks just like the pictures and is in a great location, close to Copacabana beach.  We felt very safe - the building had 24 hour security and the apartment had a safe. It would have have been a bit more convenient if there was a second mirror outside the washroom (by the second sink) - it would have just made getting ready a bit faster in the mornings.  If you stay there, you also have to try the croissants at a bakery called, Boulangerie Guerin - just one street away!  We would definitely recommend staying here!",1
45929,Jan was extremely helpful. His Appatment is amazing with great views from the balcony. It’s very central to shops and restaurants and a 5 min walk to Ipanema beach :),1

4190,"We had a wonderful time in Rio! The studio is great! It is very well designed. Everything works perfectly well and Internet is faster than what we have in Switzerland! The location is great too! About 5 minutes walk to the beach of Copacabana, and located in a safe neighborhood. The bus station to go to the Sugar Loaf is about 10 minutes walk and the subway and the supermarket are only 3 minutes walking distance. Ipanema is only a 30 minute walk or you can take the subway (2 stations). Catherine and Alan were very helpful in helping us organize our trip. They were very patient with all our questions and fast in responding emails. They also helped us book our transportation to the apartment and all went very smoothly. We also loved the handbook loaded with all sorts of recommendations. We tried out a few restaurants and were not disappointed. We also went to Churrascaria Carretao (10 minutes walk) as my husband loves grilled meat (very touristy, get there early to avoid the tourist buses!). The hotel Othon has a restaurant on the top floor with a beautiful view of the beach of Copacabana. The food is rather pricey but the view is definitely worth it! The restaurant Colombo in the Fort of Copacabana is supposed to be good too, unfortunately we ran out of time! There are some very nice markets on Sundays. When heading to the hippie market in Ipanema stop at this very small market off Avenida Atlantica just before the Fort of Capacabana! They sell great pastels and the best caldos de cane! There is also an information center on Copacabana only a few minutes  towards Leme... And all this in short walking distance from the studio! 
We highly recommend this place!

174105,"A great place to stay! Close to supermarkets, shopping, metro, busses, pharmacies. The apt is nice and cosy and very well equipped! Yes, the street is busy (and loud) but this is often the case in Rio. I would definitely stay again in Samara‘s place!",1

We had no issue except for the brand new oven which broke suddenly due to technical default and she was very available to handle the situation. We felt very happy and comfortable there. I think it's great for a couple or a couple with a kid. Just notice that you're right in front the awesome view of the Mureta, so that can be a bit noisy at night with the bus passing. For us, it was no issue. Would rent again without hesitation.",1

We had to locate the sheets and make the bed first thing on arriving.  Marcela did come to the condo to check on the bathroom light and said a repairman would come to fix it the following Mon. The light in the bathroom was not repaired the entire week and a half we were there making it very dark. 
The location is very good and the day doorman was excellent. ",0

30741,"We came without hardly having planned a thing, and left having experienced the exact perfect things in Rio.
This was just ridiculous. I have never been treated so well in any hotel or Airbnb.
From the second we got there, Marcio helped me find a safe parking spot for my car. While we did that, Claudio went preparing some of the best welcome drinks I could ever fantasize about. We walked in, and there were hugs, cool cocktails, and a fresh room to welcome us.
Through the whole stay, Marcio provided perfect recommendations on where to go, how to get there, and insider tips on the city. We felt SO at home and comfortable both in their home and in the city thanks to this.
I sincerely recommend staying here for the breakfast alone. It was literally one of everything, warm fresh coffee, fresh fruit, prepared ollas of eggs and tomatoes. So complete that despite walking all around the city, we hardly needed food until the evening. 
I feel like we went to a good friends house and got a VIP experience of Rio because of it. 
The subway, beach, and Copacabana are just a block or two away. No way to find better location.",1

Furthermore, the apartment itself is super comfortable, the bed is great, the AC, ultra fast working stove/oven and the washing machine/dryer are greAt and make it extra comfortable! We really recommend staying here, as a couple or just as friends - both great!",1

173304,"An absolute gem of location and apartment.
The apt is probably  on one of the quietest streets in all of Rio de Janeiro. Besides that, you are one block from the hub of all of the restaurants. Some of our favorite restaurants or along the street Dias Ferreira. There’s also a supermarket half a block away to buy your bread in the morning and anything else you might want. The location is absolutely superb. The apartment is  well decorated, modern and clean. There were a couple of issues with the water and shower when we arrived but Fabio was excellent in resolving them all. 

 You should note that this apartment faces the back meaning you sometimes listen to your neighbors. Not a big deal but not huge amount of privacy. A detail that I loved about the apartment is that the host has provided you with all of her best sheets, meaning it seems you might have her grandmother sheets which are percale with beautiful embroidery. It is touches like that that I think are so nice.",1

Mariangela met us there and was super friendly - making sure everything was fine and offered to give tips and advice if we need it. Only thing to note is that the road outside is quite busy and a bit noisy - didn't cause me any problems, but if you're very sensitive it might be a problem (there is a room at the back of the apartment which is very quiet).

It is very light and open plan, unlike a lot of properties in the area. It is based in the hustle and bustle of Ipanema but still felt very safe with the 24hr concierge. It is close to the beach and lots of really nice bars and restaurants. There isn’t a single thing I’d change about the place.

One part of the wooden floor was unglue, and the wardrobes are smelly and humidity. It is very good localizated, and the building is safe but not so clean. Renata was solicitous but she could solve the problem with the floor or the hot place. For the smell on the wardrobes, she has an extra place outside to hang the stuff. It was more than a room of a hotel (with no room services at all!) than an apartment. We went there for a few days so we did have time to change for another place.",0
136,"Unfortunately, our experience with this rental was very negative. In fact, if we didn’t love Rio so much, our vacation would have been completely ruined. First and foremost, the roof leaked—both outside and inside the apartment. At one point, there was a baby bathtub on the floor catching water in the entrance hallway and various containers from the kitchen on the floor catching water inside the apartment. It appears that this apartment has long had a problem with water infiltration, as evidenced by the mildew and mold on practically every wall. In the master bath, there is even a piece of wood separating the floor tiles from the shower stall (it’s called a saddle, I think) was so water-logged and rotted that stepping on created the most disgusting squishing sound. \xa0Unlucky for these owners, the leaks were made all the more evident because for two or three days during our visit there was heavy rainfall in Rio. And, during one of the deluges, several inches of water must have collected on the roof (it seems that the contractors accidentally plugged an evacuation outlet) because water ran from the roof into the courtyard below for nearly three hours. Besides leaks, the water pressure throughout the apartment, especially in the kitchen, was practically non-existent for most of our stay. \xa0On some days, we resorted to washing dishes in the hallway bathroom because for some odd reason the water pressure wasn’t as low there. While we’re talking about the kitchen, please note that the refrigerator pictured in the listing is small. \xa0It’s, in fact, a mini-refrigerator, and it’s entirely too small for an apartment that is supposed to be able to accommodate 8 adults, especially those who like to feed themselves breakfast instead of going out every morning. \xa0To Marina’s credit when we complained that the first coffee maker was faulty—it, wait for it, LEAKED—she replaced it immediately. Here are some other examples of Marina’s overpraising and underperforming: \xa0Of the six keys to the front door, only one worked. (She eventually replaced them with working ones.) There was construction noise—the sound of hammering, drilling, and water falling from the roof onto the courtyard five stories below—almost every day of our residence. Most days the single elevator was out of service because it was being used to haul construction materials (like sand and cement) and debris. \xa0The doorman was very unfriendly, almost hostile, whenever he was on duty, which was almost never. Beware that there is A/C only in the three bedrooms. The listing does not make this clear. Finally, the listing promised that we had access to a washer and dryer in the apartment. In reality, the washer and dryer were locked away behind a glass door and we were advised that we could only do laundry if we booked the maids and paid them to do it. \xa0After some back and forth and bargaining with Marina, coupled with the leak issues, she left the door open. But, as our luck would have...",0
139,"it was my horrible experience. The apartment has an unpleasant smell, view to favela- very repulsive, the bathroom not to mention ... I had to buy 5 different dezinfection products, and even than i had to use toilet paper just to seat on toalet desk, that's why toilet blocked three times, ... can you think ... I was taking a shower with my flip flops, the sheets were already used and not changed, the apartment is dark and depressive ... a non-stop pounding, loud neighbors,  ... horrible experience. It just disgusts me to stay there, so I left early, when the toilet vas blocked for the third time and paid almost the same amount for the remaining days, as I have for this place. Better to go to hotel. My journey has been corrupted because of this, my stomach still hurts now.",0
143,"This was a very bad experience and I would definitely NOT recommend staying at this apartment or at any of this host\'s other properties. Before we booked the apartment, we emailed her and asked if each of the 3 bedrooms had air conditioning and she replied yes. Relying on that (because we know how hot and humid Rio can be), we booked the place for our family.The air conditioning in one of the three bedrooms did not work for three of the four days of our stay. It was impossible to sleep or spend any time in that room because it was so hot and 2 of us were forced to sleep on the sofas in the living room which were very uncomfortable and we did not sleep well at all. The host sent a repairman twice to the apt to try to repair it, but he never fixed it. She ignored my emails on the last day and did not even try to send someone up to fix it for our last night. When I asked for compensation, since we had paid for a three bedroom apt with air conditioning in each bedroom, and we did not get that, she refused and commented to me by email ""Rio is not New York- and when things break they are not easy to fix."" I think the responsibility for that should fall on her shoulders, not ours. She should also make sure her apartment is in good working order, and not rent it out until it is. Also, as a side note, the amenities provided in the apartment are very sparse. I used the two small hand towels that were provided to us for 4 people for 4 days to wipe the water that dripped from the air conditioner onto the shelves of the closet where our clothes were (which got wet) and from the wood floors, and then had to ""beg"" for replacement towels. She emailed me that if I wanted towels changed every 2 days I ""should have booked the Fasano Hotel at 800 dollars a day per room""  - in my opinion, not an appropriate response from a host who misrepresented the condition of her apt, gave up trying to fix it during our stay, and then refused to compensate us for the problem. All in all, a very negative experience.",0
147,Great location especially for carnival. Claudia was very helpful and gave us lots of advice if we needed and responded quickly to all communication.

I always felt safe and secure walking around outside around the apartment.  Hardly anyone drives down her street and there is a great cafe/kilo restaurant just across the street from her apartment -- literally a 15 second walk -- that is awesome.  Good food (including healthy options) and great service.  I went there multiple times during my week-long stay.   You're also a short walk to the beach and a much shorter walk to a metro stop, which is great for exploring the rest of Rio.  Seriously, the location is excellent.  \r\n\r\nThe apartment is exactly as pictured -- no complaints.  We even had access to converters for our electrical plugs/outlets, which was super helpful.  \r\n\r\nGreat experience -- definitely stay here if you're planning a trip to Rio! :)",1
40733,"If you're planning visiting Rio, you must consider Gisella's place, it's located in the heart of Leblon, 1/2 block to the beach, 2 block to major street and subway, surrounded by tons of great restaurants and shops, it's nice, clean, and convenient, not to mention Gisella is very attentive, wrote me email every few days to make sure we have everything we needed, or if we need any assistance, she's truly wonderful.",1
39425,"What a joy it was to stay at ""Ipanema Village,"" and be hosted by Marcia! I felt really great about the decision I made, and was really glad I followed my instinct on all the various options here on AirBnb in and near Ipanema. / If you want a taste of the old world Ipanema, when Astrid Gilberto was singing Bossa Nova, and Jobim composing, this is the place to stay. It has great charm, character, and inspires relaxation and reverie. / My emails with Marcia gave me a degree of trust and comfort that I was staying somewhere safe and welcoming. During my visit my interactions with her were so warm, inviting and (Website hidden by Airbnb) acquainting me with the culture and locale. / I would gladly return to her property, or recommend it to others. / If you want ""chic"" or ""modern"" this isn't likely your vibe, and there are plenty of hi-rises in Ipanema and nearby. / But, with less than a block to walk to the beach, the fabulous restaurant Zaza, or the amazing Bossa Nova club Vinicius, what's not to like? / There is also the added perk of ""Benta,"" the skiddish but sweet and adorable house cat. If you're a cat person you'll enjoy flirting with you as you wish and seeing her warm up to you over your stay. / - Paul ",1

The location is simply top-class, with a mere 3 minutes walk to Ipanema beach and grocery stores also just around the corner. Check-in was extremely easy and convenient for us, and Luisa was very receptive throughout our stay! We couldn‘t have had a better time here! Thank you so much!",1

53983,"Perfect location in Ipanema for a stay. The entrance to the building had a very friendly guard where we could pick up the key that the host had left for us - very easy check in.
The apartment was nice - lots of space and well equipped. Nice terrace on the second floor with a view to Cristo.",1
10592,"Ton is an incredibly knowledgeable and interactive host. He has thought of all of the details travelers need for a great stay; he even provided ear plugs, rain coats and umbrellas (though we didn’t need them in the end). He is very willing to give advice on local attractions and things to do. The apartment is in a great location and he keeps it clean even with a full house. The only thing I would note is that his roommate does smoke in the house so we often would smell that in our room too (Ton has put an air freshener in the room which does help a bit). Ton is such a thoughtful host and I would recommend this place if you are looking for a shared space with an incredibly helpful host :)",1
